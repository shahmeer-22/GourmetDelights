# Restaurant Website Using HTML & CSS Only
This is my first-ever web development project, where I designed and built a fully responsive, multi-page restaurant website using only HTML and CSS means no frameworks and no JavaScript.

It includes all the basic pages youâ€™d expect from a real restaurant website: Home, Menu, and Contact Us. This project helped me understand the structure of a website, how layout and design work together, and how CSS helps in styling and brings everything to life.

## Pages Included
### Home 
Welcoming page with a hero section and intro text

### Menu 
Displays food items in a responsive, grid-style layout

### Contact Us 
Essential restaurant information along with a location attached through Google Maps.

## Features
- Clean and semantic HTML5 structure
- Styled with modern CSS using Flexbox layout, hover effects, consistent color scheme
- Smooth navigation bar and footer on all pages
- Simple, easy-to-understand code and extremely beginner friendly

## What I Learned
- How to structure a website using semantic HTML
- CSS layout techniques like Flexbox
- Page linking and folder structuring for multi-page sites
- Design consistency and user-friendly interfaces
- How to build something real from scratch and actually enjoy it!
